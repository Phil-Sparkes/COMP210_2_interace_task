# COMP210_2_interace_task


The game I will be making for the VR project will be a top down bullet hell dungeon crawler. This will be achieved by using the VR controllers in the style of a twin stick shooter. 

This project will only have three key requirements:

* Top down camera
*	Movement
* Shooting

One controller will be pointed where the player wants their character to move and the other will be used to point at where they want to shoot. 

This is taking the traditional twin stick approach but using motion controllers instead of joysticks. 

Due to the nature of the game the camera may have to be fixed meaning not much functionality can be gained from the headset itself but depending on the art assets this might change and give the player some freedom in their view.

I originally wanted to work with AR using the HoloLens but because the game project is being developed on the unreal engine and HoloLens not having the best unreal support currently this is not practical. 

I also looked at changing the camera to first person and have the player be in the dungeon. Some VR titles that have achieved this:

## A Legend of Luca (£14.99)

VR rouge like dungeon crawler in the first-person perspective, rated very positively.

## VR Dungeon Knight (£14.99)

First person randomly generated dungeon crawler also having very positive reviews

## The Crypts of Anak Shaba – VR (£0.79)

This one is also exploring “crypts” in a dungeon crawler style but rated very badly because of the number of game breaking bugs and bad controls.

After looking at these three games it’s clear that this style of VR game has been explored and can be successful. For my project I want to try something different though so going for the top down approach. Having a look on steam and online I found some games that have tried to achieve this.

## AirMech® Command (£14.99)

This game is a top down strategy that uses VR to command the troops, shows how VR can be used for top down games and is rated highly.

## Volume: Coda (Yet to be released)

Volume: Coda is a PlayStation VR exclusive stealth inspired puzzle game using a VR top down view.

## Salvaged (£9.99)

Salvaged is very interesting in its approach to VR, the VR experience is a first-person dungeon crawler, but one player (using mouse and keyboard) has control over all the other players movements using a top down view. The concept is liked but the game currently has massive performance and UI problems so is rated negatively on steam.

These games show that top down can be used to a level of success with VR, but a dungeon crawler style game has not been attempted yet.
